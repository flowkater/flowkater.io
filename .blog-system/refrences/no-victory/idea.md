We talk about that a lot at work. How do you know if a service is successful? If you ask if it's okay, it means it wasn't successful. For example, if you have 10 million people or 10 million subscribers, you're considered successful . But is this okay ? This state of affairs is, yes, not really a problem .

I think it's really important to quickly eliminate fake problems, so if you change the question a little to ask why you can't find the real problem, it's because you spend too much time on fake problems. Oh, I've now set up 20 of them. Most of them failed. Most of the rooms are now empty and the only ones that have survived are the Remember the Masterpiece maps.

The second is that I don't think 3.3 customers want it now, but they are usually mistaken. I think that's what you want. Is this what customers really want ? Where is the evidence? Have you ever met a customer who gave you 800,000 won and then bought you chicken and beer after you did that to him while he was laughing so hard? hello. My name is Beomseop Kim, and I am the former Chief Growth Officer and founder of David Senvilance .

David Lenz is now a company that created tax rate 3.3 . So far, it's a service that has helped 24 million subscribers receive nearly 2 trillion won in tax refunds. Oh, I've now set up 20 of them. There are probably around 40 of them .

Most of them failed. Most of them have failed and now we can see that only two have survived, the first being the Remember Light and Shadow Map. The second one is now 3.3. Actually, the team atmosphere when we were making Remember wasn't good.

After making about 20 of them, we were on the verge of failure, so we didn't make them with any great passion compared to the previous service, but we just made them in that kind of scattered atmosphere, and it turned out well. It's a bit weird . So why is that? When I compared Remember with the services I made in the past, I realized that I was the one who came up with the idea. Such a great idea.

The atmosphere was good when we formed the team . Well, I was proud of making it and that kind of service, but when I was making Remember, I was going around looking for investment, and the original business plan wasn't working, so the investment company representative said, " Hey, I have a light and dark tube. Can you explain this to me?" and it felt like he was trying to make us do some part-time work. So I thought, "Should we just give it a try?" Those engineers also said that this is not a technical problem at all and that this is so easy that anyone can do it.

It's not like I put a lot of energy into it or anything. Yes, I just made this for a week or two. It's a service, and now that I see it working well, I'm going to assume that that's the biggest difference . I should n't come up with ideas.

I'm usually mistaken now about what I think the customer wants. So, I hear a lot of people saying to do what the customer wants, but I think that's what they want . In 2015, when I founded Jarvis Villain, I started in 3.32, so there was a five-year period. I've been digging for five years.

My idea is that there's a really old service in the tax market called Verzon, and if you look at it, it's really crappy. Just looking around, I hear a lot of similar stories from people around me. Oh, this kind of shabby service still exists? Well, I think if we just make it, we'll make it better than that. I started with the thought that I could make it fancier than I was, and after struggling for 5 years, in 2019, when I was struggling with miscellaneous expenses and the company atmosphere was not good, by chance, there was a tax accountant who worked with us and a member of our team, and before he joined, another company had not done any year-end tax settlement or anything like that .

So, I have a year-end tax settlement that I haven't done yet, and I was talking to my tax accountant, and he said he'd calculate it for me, so I did and it came out to 800,000 won. So we all ate chicken together that day. After seeing that, I thought there might be more people like this, so I started doing it. So, actually, I didn't come up with that idea at the time.

The tax accountant said that these people would come to him every May. But from the tax accountant's perspective, it doesn't make any money . Can I get around 100,000 won ? But tax accountants are busy dealing with many clients who pay more than 1 million won in May, which is the peak season, and they do n't like clients who pay 100,000 won. If Jarvis could solve this with technology, wouldn't he still have 100,000 won left? In my opinion, there are ten thousand customers like that.

So these two cases, now 3.3 or something like Remember, these two, I came up with the idea, so I thought, what, whoever, I'm going to turn the competition upside down. I will change the world. It's not something like that, it's just handling the investor's business card holder . And aren't there more employees in our company who missed out on the year-end horticulture ? And in that one case, I didn't create a service for 800,000 won, but I already received 800,000 won.

How great would it be to have 800,000 won for free? So now it's like buying chicken and stuff like that. When I see that look that I like so much, I think that's where I should start. That's the biggest difference between the 40 that failed and the two that succeeded . Is this what customers really want? Where is the evidence? Have you ever met a customer who gave you 800,000 won and then bought you some toothpaste after you did that to me while I was laughing so angrily ? I think this was a really important point.

It occurred to me that I could only know the real problem after I found it . For example, we talk about that a lot at work. Now you ask, how do you know if a service is successful? If you ask if it's okay, it means it wasn't successful. For example, if you have 10 million people, 10 million subscribers, you're considered successful.

3.3 We provided a service, but when viral marketing like this came out, saying, "Try it out even if you put it in a KakaoTalk chatroom," it became clear to the customer that this was a real problem. And it's clear to everyone that we handled it well . But is that okay ? I think it's really important to quickly eliminate fake problems that can't be called real problems. So, if we change the question a bit to why we can't find the real problem, it's because we spend too much time on fake problems.

I've been in business for 10 years, and most of the time I'm stuck on fake problems. So, I think the reason I'm talking about this Restartup MVP is to reduce the fake problems. So, most MVPs are failures . When something fails, you should not be attached to it and just let it go, but you keep trying to save it .

Wouldn't it be okay if I added a little more of this ? Wouldn't it be okay to add a little more of this ? So, if you improve anything, it gets a little better. 100 people use it. So, if you calculate this, 110 people use it, 200 people use it, 300 people use it, and the standard for dividing whether it is a real problem or a fake problem is the size of the problem that I want to solve . I think that is the standard for me.

I was creating 100,000 paying customers, or 1 million , or 10 million. But what I expected was ten million people. But when I draw an extension line, it seems like it's only 1 million people . The real problem I'm looking for is, yes, the size is there, but if it's not that big, you have to make it fast .

If you look at it as a tile of opportunity to quickly find the real problem without any hesitation, it is said that if you make a startup shoulder service, one out of ten will succeed, so how will I get to the plate ten times ? If it takes more than a year to solve a problem, it means you have to do it for 10 years . If possible, it will be finished within a month. I'll finish it within a week . I think it's really important to do this over a year, as it allows us to do it on a much faster cycle .

I do n't believe what you say. The definition of good, even if I don't believe my own thoughts, is good for the customer . Is it good to tell customers that something is good for them? Knowing that clearly is what pays the bills . And you pay twice, not once.

For example, there are restaurants where people go while swearing. The line is too long. There are restaurants where you go and the service is so unfriendly that you end up like this. I think the ingredients for the Father's Day dish are a bit unusual.

I do n't think words like that can truly reveal the customer's feelings, and the only way to know for sure is through payment rates. Are you paying? Will I visit again? 3.3 Now, if you read a lot of customer comments, you'll see that a lot of people say that the price is too expensive . Right? So, we also want to lower the price and are working on that now, but please keep using it. That's why I keep looking at it .

When you set the price at which customers will pay, you determine the price at which customers will actually pay. It's not a thought or a concept, it's just a decision based on the payment rate. So, coming up with an idea is a kind of hypothesis. Hey, customers will like this.

But when you check that and take it out, does the conversion rate increase when you add a feature? Does the retention rate increase? Now, looking at these things, if it goes in the opposite direction, it should be removed immediately, and even if it is maintained, it is actually a useless function, and is there something that is clearly better? That's how we keep getting the facts out. In practice, there is a lot of talk about creating fake pages and creating landing pages to experiment with, but the best way to do this is to try not to do it as much as possible. Well, after making it, I think I should market it then, but let's say I made it in reverse . Let's say we did everything.

What do you do next? Now, that's when I feel a little dizzy. The first thing I think about is selling it. Now, the landing page experiment and fake page experiment that textbooks talk about are not just made out of thin air, but sold. Either take the money or just take the phone number.

But if it doesn't go well, we apologize to the customers and now we go to extremes and cancel, and 3.3 was actually exactly that case, but when we created a landing page, it was so thrilling. The next step was to speculate . So, we provided the service through chat . I have a tax accountant sit next to me, receive the data, then calculate it, then I take it and paste it into my account, send it to him via chat, and then I make the payment, which is 15,000 won.

They told me our company's account number. And then, the exchange rate for this was really really good. Ah, if things continue like this, this will be a hit. And now that we've made it, it looks like it's going to be a lot more supportive of card payments .

But the star tuning doesn't come out that much. Now, I thought something big was wrong and I searched for the reason and for about a week, I found out why. When I do it, I feel like a person would pay 15,000 won like this, so I definitely get the feeling that a person would do it. So, when people actually did it and made it into a service, it worked .

It does n't even take 1 or 2 minutes to get a refund and you have to pay 15,000 won. There is no fundamental difference in the service because of this, but here the payment conversion rate is 60%, but here it is less than 10%, so we intentionally created that feeling a little . What we're doing now is gathering information, what we're doing, and what feedback we've intentionally made it take longer, in a way . Then, the payment rate went up similarly.

It's about creating a pay-per-click page with products that are guaranteed to sell. Then, if it doesn't sell here, you can confirm that it won't sell even if you make it like this . This is something that shouldn't be made . This is something that should never be made, and almost like, hey, I tried selling this and it sold.

But it sells so well. Then let's make a big bet . Of course, there are risks to this . There's a risk of not being able to make it, but I think a much bigger risk is not selling it.

I'm working with the idea of ​​defining a concept that will sell and somehow making it work . So, most of what we call training seems to go against our instincts. I think I learned something while skiing. When you ski, the first thing you do is to buy it at a right angle to the slope .

Like this. But this is against instinct. If gravity is always pulling like this, I feel like it's safe to use it for collection and I've lived my whole life like that. But on a mountain with such a steep slope, leaning forward is crazy .

This won't do . But you need to understand this in your head . Now that I can press this elasticity on the key, I understand this in my head and I know it in my head now. Arthur, you have to.

Now the ski instructor is Tragra. It 's scary. So what does the instructor do? It's okay to come. It's okay to stand.

It's okay to tell people to come. And through training, it's okay to continue to come. Ah, I get feedback that it's better to do it this way. Oh, this ski moves better.

So now, as you get more and more used to it, you develop new authority and new instincts. I think that's something that needs some training now, and that's why textbook-like texts about startup-related ideas and such do n't do well. I think that's precisely why . Just knowing isn't enough.

That's why we instinctively reject it . For example, when experimenting with fake phases, you instinctively think, "Oh, that won't work ." Something feels uneasy. Can I sell it first? Instinctively, I think that I shouldn't do that, so I break away from that and just try to do it. So I think we need to make it smaller.

At first, I look at one person . If you call directly and cancel, they'll give you a gift certificate, and that's how you can solve the problem. So, through this very small experiment, I was able to gain a new intuition that this is how it works. In that sense, I think that the period of ruining the ancestral rite service was a period of training for me.

I have been running a business for almost 16 years since 2009, but I think that the book alone is not enough for starting a business. I need time for training to get used to the contents in the book by accepting them intuitively and instinctively, even if they go against my instincts . Well, I've read a lot of books and studied enough, but how far do I have to go to apply it in real life ? Uh, now, this so-called real-life situation is not a very refined environment like a laboratory environment, so to put it simply, there could be problems at home, or problems with the children, so I think it would be helpful if I could focus on whether I can actually do what the textbook tells me to do and talk about those parts. Oh, you can find specific examples of finding customer value at Iho School..
